# Problem Title

**ID:**  7
**Difficulty:**  Medium
**Topic:**  Arrays & Hashing

## Problem Description
Given an integer array nums, return an array output where output[i] is the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].

Each product is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

Follow-up: Could you solve it in O(n) time without using the division operation?

## Approach
I FINALLY SOLVE MY FIRST WITHOUT ANY REAL HELP. I even got the follow-up solution, my initial approach was the division method but I think my brute force is really good!

## Code
```python
class Solution:
    def productExceptSelf(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        length = len(nums)
        out = [1]*length
        i = 0
        
        while i < length:
            I=0
            while I < length:
                if i != I:
                    out[i] *= nums[I] 
                I+=1
            i+=1
        return out
