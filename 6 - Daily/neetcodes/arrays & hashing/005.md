# Valid Anagram

**ID:**  2
**Difficulty:**  Easy
**Topic:**  Arrays & Hashing

## Problem Description
Given two strings s and t, return true if the two strings are anagrams of each other, otherwise return false.

An anagram is a string that contains the exact same characters as another string, but the order of the characters can be different.

## Approach
I originally wanted to use some sort of char dictionary and then modulo the expression, as there would be even results of chars and I could tell then if they were even but. .sorted is goated!

## Code
```python
class Solution:
    def isAnagram(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        if len(s) != len(t):
            return False
        length = len(s)

        if sorted(s) != sorted(t):
            return False
        return True
