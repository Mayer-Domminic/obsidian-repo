# Top k Frequent Elements

**ID:**  5
**Difficulty:**  Medium
**Topic:**  Arrays & Hashing

## Problem Description
Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the k most frequent elements within the array.

The test cases are generated such that the answer is always unique.

You may return the output in any order.

## Approach
It was a pretty simple problem considering [002], however getting the MOST frequent was a little bit difficult. I did not remember `[:k]` would return UP to `k`.

## Code
```python
class Solution:
    def topKFrequent(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:
        freq = {}

        for number in nums:
            if number in freq:
                freq[number] = freq[number] + 1
            else:
                freq[number] = 1

        return sorted(freq, key=freq.get, reverse=True)[:k]
