# Encode and Decode Strings

**ID:**  6
**Difficulty:**  Medium
**Topic:**  Arrays & Hashing

## Problem Description
Design an algorithm to encode a list of strings to a single string. The encoded string is then decoded back to the original list of strings.

Please implement encode and decode

## Approach
This one I’ve struggled with multiple times, I can never seem to come up with a solution solo. Encode was super simple and it made sense with the hints. Since I’m a bit rusty with python loops and iteration it made it more difficult, however I likely could’ve come to a solution if given that additional experience.

## Code
```python
class Solution:

    def encode(self, strs: List[str]) -> str:
        encoded = ""
        for s in strs:
            encoded += str(len(s)) + "|" + s
        return encoded

    def decode(self, s: str) -> List[str]:
        decoded = []
        i = 0
        while i < len(s):
            length_str = ""
            while s[i] != "|":  # the only real part I needed help with
                length_str += s[i]
                i += 1
            length = int(length_str)
            i += 1 
            decoded.append(s[i:i + length]) # 3:6 for ex
            i += length
        return decoded
