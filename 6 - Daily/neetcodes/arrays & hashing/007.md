# Valid Sudoku

**ID:**  8
**Difficulty:**  Medium
**Topic:**  Arrays & Hashing

## Problem Description
You are given a a 9 x 9 Sudoku board board. A Sudoku board is valid if the following rules are followed:

Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without duplicates.
Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without duplicates.
Each of the nine 3 x 3 sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits 1-9 without duplicates.
Return true if the Sudoku board is valid, otherwise return false

## Approach
I couldn’t initialize the dictionaries correctly, I roughly had an idea but `[1]*9` is not the same as i: set() for i in range(9). This one I was not super successful with, as the rows/cols distinction was messing me up quite a bit. The cube int is using // floor math which literally would’ve solved it kinda.

## Code
```python
class Solution:
    def isValidSudoku(self, board: List[List[str]]) -> bool:
        rows = {i: set() for i in range(9)}
        cols = {j: set() for j in range(9)}
        cube = {k: set() for k in range(9)}
        i, j, k = 0, 0, 0

        for i in range(9):
            for j in range(9):
                ele = board[i][j] 
                if ele != ".":
                    if (ele in rows[i]) or (ele in cols[j]) or (ele in cube[(i // 3) * 3 + (j // 3)]):
                        return False
                    rows[i].add(ele)
                    cols[j].add(ele)
                    cube[(i // 3) * 3 + (j // 3)].add(ele)
        return True
