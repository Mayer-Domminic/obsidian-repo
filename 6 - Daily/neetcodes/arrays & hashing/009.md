# Two Sum

**ID:**  3
**Difficulty:**  Easy
**Topic:**  Arrays & Hashing

## Problem Description
`Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return the indices i and j such that nums[i] + nums[j] == target and i != j.

You may assume that every input has exactly one pair of indices i and j that satisfy the condition.

Return the answer with the smaller index first.

## Approach
This was really easy! Super simple solution, I got tripped up on a few of the test cases and making sure i!=j && just returned the sorted order of the array as a dirty fix if the numbers are the same in the array.

## Code
```python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -%3E List[int]:
        i = 0
        sets = set(nums)

        for i in range(len(nums)):
            print(nums[i])
            nexT = target-nums[i]
            if nexT in sets:
                if i != nums.index(nexT):
                    return sorted([i, nums.index(nexT)])>)
