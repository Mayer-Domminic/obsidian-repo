# Longest Consecutive Sequence

**ID:**  9
**Difficulty:**  Hard Medium?
**Topic:**  Arrays & Hashing

## Problem Description
Given an array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive sequence of elements that can be formed.

A consecutive sequence is a sequence of elements in which each element is exactly 1 greater than the previous element. The elements do not have to be consecutive in the original array.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.

## Approach
I originally went for a brute force + sorted approach. However, was unsuccessful in some test cases but it did feel good to sort of have an approach in my first hard that actually did something. I had to use a solution, but as soon as I understood the left neighbor right neighbor approach for this problem it was very simple.

## Code
```python
class Solution:
    def longestConsecutive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        numSet = set(nums)
        longest = 0

        for num in numSet:
            if (num - 1) not in numSet:
                length = 1
                while (num + length) in numSet:
                    length += 1
                longest = max(length, longest)
        return longest
