# Group Anagrams

**ID:**  2
**Difficulty:**  Medium
**Topic:**  Arrays & Hashing

## Problem Description
Given an array of strings strs, group all anagrams together into sublists. You may return the output in any order.

An anagram is a string that contains the exact same characters as another string, but the order of the characters can be different.

## Approach
My approach is still naive, but I also could not figure out how to convert the list (sort) to a tuple (tuple(sort)). I believe this is because it changes the output of the sort to an array of chars instead of a string. Which is interesting, but this also allows for the dictionary method basically what [001] does.

## Code
```python
class Solution:
    def groupAnagrams(self, strs: List[str]) -> List[List[str]]:
            strings = {}

            for string in strs:
                sort = tuple(sorted(string))
                if sort in strings:
                    strings[sort].append(string)
                else:
                    strings[sort] = [string]

            return list(strings.values())
