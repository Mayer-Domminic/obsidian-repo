# Contains Duplicate

**ID:**  1/9
**Difficulty:**  Easy
**Topic:** Arrays & Hashing 

## Problem Description
Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears more than once in the array, otherwise return false.

## Approach
I knew that a dictionary was necessary, and a single loop was required. I did not remember how to access the data within the dictionary or even check if there were duplicates much less count them.

## Code
```python
class Solution:
    def hasDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        counts = {}
        for element in nums:
            if element in counts:
                return True
            else:
                counts[element] = 1
        return False
