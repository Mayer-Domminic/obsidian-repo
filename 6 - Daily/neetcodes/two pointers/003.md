# Problem Title

**ID:**  
**Difficulty:**  
**Topic:**  

## Problem Description
Given an integer array nums, return all the triplets [nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]] where nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0, and the indices i, j and k are all distinct.

The output should not contain any duplicate triplets. You may return the output and the triplets in any order.

## Approach
I had initially the wrong approach, but a little bit of a better idea was to iterate through the array. Then run two pointers on the right neighbor as we could then do the [002] solution. Super sick sol.

## Code
```python
class Solution:
    def threeSum(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        length = len(nums)
        i = 0
        sol = list()
        nums = sorted(nums)

        for i in range(length):
            j, k = i+1, length-1
            target = -nums[i]
            while j < k:
                total = nums[j] + nums[k]
                if target == total:
                    out = [nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]]
                    if not out in sol:
                        sol.append(out)
                
                if total > target:
                    k -= 1
                else:
                    j += 1
        return sol
