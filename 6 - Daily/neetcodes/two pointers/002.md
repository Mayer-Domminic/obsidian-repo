# Two Integer Sum II

**ID:**  
**Difficulty:**  
**Topic:**  

## Problem Description
Given an array of integers numbers that is sorted in non-decreasing order.

Return the indices (1-indexed) of two numbers, [index1, index2], such that they add up to a given target number target and index1 < index2. Note that index1 and index2 cannot be equal, therefore you may not use the same element twice.

There will always be exactly one valid solution.

## Approach
This one I understood very well, I got the two pointer structure perfect and then after some trial n error I got the if total > target enumerate right else enumerate left. I originally did a left-=1, which would leave me in some sort of negative array thing but somewhat couldâ€™ve been done that way still.

## Code
```python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, numbers: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        length = len(numbers)
        right = length-1
        left = 0

        while left < right:
            total = numbers[left]+numbers[right]

            if total == target:
                return [left+1, right+1]
            
            if total > target:
                right -= 1
            else:
                left += 1
